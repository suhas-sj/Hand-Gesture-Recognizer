**Gesture Recognition Suite**

This repository contains a Gesture Recognition Suite with four modules designed to enable gesture-based control of various aspects of a computer interface. These modules include:

1. **Screen Enhancement Controls**:
   - **Brightness Adjustment**: Control the brightness of the screen using hand gestures.
   - **Contrast Adjustment**: Adjust the contrast of the screen using hand gestures.
   - **Gamma Correction**: Modify the gamma settings of the screen using hand gestures.
   - **Saturation Control**: Adjust the saturation of the screen using hand gestures.

2. **3D Drawing Space**:
   - **Interactive Canvas**: Users can paint on a virtual canvas in a 3D space using their fingers.
   - **Gesture Controls**: Recognize hand gestures for clearing the canvas and erasing specific portions.

3. **Sign Language Recognition**:
   - **Interpreter**: Recognize and interpret various sign language gestures such as hello, bye, yes, no, thank you, etc.
   - **Deaf and Dumb Communication**: Facilitate communication for the deaf and dumb community by translating sign language gestures into text or speech.

4. **App and Website Launcher**:
   - **Gesture-Based Navigation**: Open different applications and websites based on recognized hand gestures.
   - **Task Automation**: Perform tasks such as launching the calculator, opening the browser, accessing specific websites like YouTube, etc., using hand gestures.

### Modules Overview:

- **Screen Enhancement Controls**: Enhance the viewing experience by adjusting screen properties with intuitive hand gestures.
- **3D Drawing Space**: Explore creative possibilities with a virtual canvas and gesture-based controls for drawing and erasing.
